<h1>Tutoring</h1>

<p>In recognizing accomplished engineering students, Tau Beta Pi strives to support UCLA's community of scholars and encourage students to heighten their academic performance. Tau Beta Pi's tutoring program, one of the most rewarding and beneficial features of this engineering honor society, offers engineering and non-engineering students assistance in subjects ranging from introductory physics, chemistry and calculus, to advanced levels of computer science and other upper division engineering courses.
Patience and persistence, two attributes that define a highly qualified and exceptional tutor, are what guide Tau Beta Pi's approach to tutoring. 
Eager and dedicated Tau Beta Pi officers contribute to this program each quarter in order to foster an ideal learning environment and help improve the scholastic performance of hundreds of undergraduate students. 
Please feel encouraged and welcome to stop by Tau Beta Pi's tutoring room, located on the 6th floor of Boelter Hall in Room 6266, to introduce yourself to some of TBP's many friendly faces!
